Here’s a **reasonable permission setup** for a typical university/course management system with `Student`, `Teacher`, and `Admin` groups. I’ll focus on **Django-style permissions** (view/add/change/delete on models) plus some logical extra actions.

---

### **1️⃣ Student Group**

| Permission           | Description                                               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `view_course`        | Can see courses they are enrolled in                      |
| `view_own_grades`    | Can see their own grades/results                          |
| `enroll_in_course`   | Can enroll in available courses                           |
| `view_own_profile`   | Can view their own profile                                |
| `change_own_profile` | Can update certain fields (email, password, contact info) |

*Notes:*
